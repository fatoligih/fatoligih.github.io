<h2>Web Application basics</h2>
Learn how a request works, HTTP headers, JSON requests, how a browser works, how they communicate and send data to the servers, DNS etc. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">MDN Web</a>

<b>Common scope vulnerabilities.</b> You will need to know common scope vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Injections (SQL, Command etc.), Clickjacking, Open Redirects, etc.

<b>Read blogs.</b> Learn new techniques from other bug bounty hunters so that you can test it out during your testing.

>If you are new to Bug Bounty program, you might not feel confident that you can find something a public program. This is something that a lot of hackers are struggling with. If you havenâ€™t found a lot of security vulnerabilities yet, it might payoff to practice on Capture The Flag (CTF). Exploiting something for the first time is difficult and eye-opening. Apply the same structure if you would apply when looking in real targets as this help you a build a solid foundation and will help you to become an amazing hacker. Use bug bounty as a way to expand your knowledge and not as a race. Write simple scripts and use available tools to expand the process of expanding attack surface [...] Understand the web application and figure out what assets the web application are trying to protect. Think like an engineer of the web application. (Jobert Abma, Hackerone Cofounder)

<b>Learn how to make and then break.</b> You need to know how a web or mobile application is developed first so that you can understand how the thing works and hence how it can be broken down. This is beneficial for your long-term development rather than being a hunter that only knows how to send payloads (obtained from internet). Build a few web applications to understand how the web architecture works.

> From <a href="https://twitter.com/spaceraccoonsec/status/1250403032971407360?s=20"> Spaceraccoon's tweet</a>: To be blunt, I don't automate. I tried building a pipeline and failed. You can succeed just by learning the fundamentals. Check out @PortSwigger's web academy, watch @NahamSec's stream, read @Hacker0x01 disclosures. And learn how to build what you're hacking.
